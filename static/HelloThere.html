    <p>One day I'll figure out how to add a image of the website that cycles through each page of the webstie as you hover over the link. One day this top part of the website will be an introduction instead of a list of things to comc. Alas, neither of those days are today.</p>

            <p>Assignment Description: Create a 3 page website. Each of the websites should have links to the others. The website should contain Bio, Schedule, and Favorite Website Pages. Try to make it look nice.<br></p>
            <p>This was my first web application. It was made using basic .html and no advanced .css file. I added an extra about me page just to elaborate more about myself. It's not the prettiest thing out there but it's also not horrible.</p>

            <h3>August 29, 2023</h3>
            <p>Assignment Description: Create a website with the worst possible CSS using a CSS Style Sheet. "Get it all out of your system"<br></p>
            <p>This was a really fun project to work on despite the fact that I did most of it the morning we had to turn it in. My creative process was to once again go down the W3Schools CSS tutorial except whenever it said how to do something, I did my best to do it in the worst way possible. The only salvageable thing about this site is that if you hover over the main paragraphs, it changes to legible text just in case you want to read a ChatGPT paper about what CSS is.</p>

            <p>Assignment Description: Follow the CSS Zen Garden rules to create a themed CSS website that "looks cool" and "follows a theme"<br></p>
            <p>This project is hell because of how the paragraphs are set up. I now understand that I know nothing about CSS and formatting something without being able to create the dividers is a torture I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Fun Fact: I started formatting this page (after the assignment due date) to get more comfortable using CSS. Maybe one day it'll be completed. ;-;</p>

                <p>Assignment Description: Get one of your websites validated by W3Schools validation checker.<br></p>
                <p>I was going to be cheeky and get the Zen-Garden Website validated because it was written by people who should know what they are doing but I realized I'd only get angry that I can't actually change the HTML. Also for the record the page that is validated gets changed a lot and I my validation process did not automatically make me more cautious when writting my code I'm a firm believer of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" when programming.</p>
