            <h3>August 22nd, 2023</h3>
            <p>Assignment Description: Create a 3 page website.  Each of the websites should have links to the others.  The website should contain Bio, Schedule, and Favorite Website Pages. Try to make it look nice. <br>

            <p>This was my first web application. It was made using basic .html and no advnace .css file. I added an extra about me page just elaborate more about myself. Its not the prettiest thing out there but its also not horrible.
