            <h3>August 22nd, 2023</h3>
            <p>Assignment Description: Create a 3 page website.  Each of the websites should have links to the others.  The website should contain Bio, Schedule, and Favorite Website Pages. Try to make it look nice. <br>    </p>
            <p>Personal Notes: This was my first web application. It was made using basic .html and no advnace .css file. I added an extra about me page just elaborate more about myself. Its not the prettiest thing out there but its also not horrible.</p>

            <h2>Assignment 2: Bad CSS</h2>
            <h3>August 29, 2023</h3>
            <p>Assignment Description: Create a website with the worst possible CSS using a CSS Style Sheet. "Get it all out of your system"<br></p>
            <p>This was a really fun project to work on despite the fact that I did most of it the morning we had to turn it in. My creative process was to once again go down the W3Schools CSS tutorial except whenever it said how to do something, I did my best to do it in the worst way possible. The only salvagable thing about this site is that if you hover ofver the main paragraphs it changes to legible text just in case you want to read a ChatGPT paper about what CSS is.</p>

            <h2>Assignment 3: Cool CSS - WIP</h2>
            <h3>September 12, 2023</h3>
            <p>Assignment Description: Follow the CSS Zen Garden rules to create a themed CSS website that "looks cool" and "follows a theme"<br></p>
            <p>This project is hell because of how the paragraphs are set up. I know understand that I know nothing about CSS and formating something without being able to create the dividers is a torture I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Fun Fact: I started formatting this page (after the assignment due date) to get more comfortable using CSS. Maybe one day it'll be completed. ;-;</p>
